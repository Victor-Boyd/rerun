## Background

DROID is a robot manipulation dataset collected over a diverse set of environments that can be used to train robotic manipulation policies. The dataset contains sensor data from each joint of the robot as well as video footage from 3 stereo cameras located on wrist and on either side of the arm. In each frame it also stores the action taken which is the target position and velocity given by the teleoperator.
